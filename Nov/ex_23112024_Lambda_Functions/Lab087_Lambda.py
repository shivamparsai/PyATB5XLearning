#Lambda function or expression
# A lambda is an anonymous function that returns some form of data
# Syntax:
#   lambda parameters : expression
# parameters or arguments - like a normal function, a lambda function can accept any number of arguments
# but must have only one expression
# Expression - the expression is executed and the result is returned when the lambda function is called.
